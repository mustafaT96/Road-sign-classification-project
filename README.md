# 🛑 Road Sign Classification Project  
### A Machine Learning Approach Using Feedforward Neural Networks

This repository contains my implementation and analysis of a road-sign image classification model.  
The full experiment, code, visualizations, and evaluation are documented inside the Jupyter Notebook and its exported PDF.

## 📄 Project Summary

In this project, I built and evaluated a **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** for classifying road-sign images.  
The workflow includes data preprocessing, model development, performance evaluation, and analysis of learned representations.

## 🔧 What This Project Covers

- Loading and preprocessing the dataset (normalization, reshaping, splitting)
- Building a Feedforward Neural Network for multi-class image classification
- Training the baseline model and evaluating accuracy/loss
- Applying regularization techniques:
  - Dropout  
  - Batch Normalization  
  - L2 Regularization  
  - Learning Rate Scheduling
- Visualizing training vs. validation performance
- Saving and comparing model checkpoints
- Using UMAP to visualize how deeper layers learn more structured feature representations
